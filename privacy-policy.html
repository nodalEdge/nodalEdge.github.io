            <div class="post-content">

              <p>Wildcard Developments LTD, may collect and store data
	      about you to provide you with a fuller service via our
	      nodalEdge product (<a
	      href="http://www.nodalEdge.com">www.nodalEdge.com</a>). It
	      is nodalEdge’s policy to respect your privacy regarding
	      any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<p>If
you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please
contact our <a href="mailto:info@nodaledge.com">support
team</a>.</p>

<h2 class="block-title">Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like
most website operators, nodalEdge collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
time of each visitor request. nodalEdge’s
purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
understand how nodalEdge’s visitors use its website.
From time to time, nodalEdge may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>


<h2 class="block-title">Gathering of
Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Certain
visitors to nodalEdge’s websites choose to interact
with nodalEdge in ways that require nodalEdge to gather personally-identifying
information. The amount and type of information that nodalEdge gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
For example, we ask visitors who sign up for nodalEdge
to fill out a form, whose data is stored online. Those who engage in
transactions with nodalEdge are asked to provide
additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
information required to process those transactions. In each case, nodalEdge collects such information only insofar as is
necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction
with nodalEdge. nodalEdge
does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.</p>

<h2 class="block-title">Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>nodalEdge may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
its websites.nodalEdge may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, nodalEdge
does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below.</p>

<h2 class="block-title">Protection of Certain </h2>

<p>nodalEdge discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations that (i) need to know that information
in order to process it on nodalEdge’s behalf or to
provide services available at nodalEdge’s websites,
and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
your home country; by using nodalEdge’s websites, you
consent to the transfer of such information to them. nodalEdge will not rent or sell potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other
than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described
above, nodalEdge discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response
to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when nodalEdge believes in good faith that disclosure is
reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of nodalEdge,
third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of
a nodalEdge website and have supplied your email address, nodalEdge may occasionally send you an email to tell you
about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with
what’s going on with nodalEdge
and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or
via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
users. nodalEdge takes all
measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2 class="block-title">Cookies</h2>

<p>A
cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
visitor returns. nodalEdge
uses cookies to help nodalEdge identify and track
visitors, their usage of nodalEdge website, and their
website access preferences. nodalEdge
visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set
their browsers to refuse cookies before using nodalEdge’s
websites, with the drawback that certain features of nodalEdge’s
websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2 class="block-title">Business Transfers</h2>

<p>If
nodalEdge, or substantially all of its assets, were
acquired, or in the unlikely event that nodalEdge
goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the
assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that
such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of nodalEdge
may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2 class="block-title">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>Although
most changes are likely to be minor, nodalEdge may
change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in nodalEdge’s
sole discretion. nodalEdge
encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this
Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
